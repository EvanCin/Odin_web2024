    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Picture taken in May 2023.
        Seattle, a city on Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest, is surrounded by water, mountains and evergreen forests, 
        and contains thousands of acres of parkland. Washington State's largest city, it's home to a large tech industry, 
        with Microsoft and Amazon headquartered in its metropolitan area. The futuristic Space Needle, 
        a 1962 World's Fair legacy, is its most iconic landmark. â€• Google
